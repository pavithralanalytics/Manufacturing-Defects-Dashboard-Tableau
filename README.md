# Manufacturing Defects Dashboard – 2024 (Tableau)
This project presents a Tableau-based analytics dashboard that analyzes manufacturing defects recorded in 2024. It focuses on defect types, severity, repair costs, monthly trends, and the effectiveness of inspection methods to support data-driven quality improvement.

# 🎯 Objectives
Identify major defect types and severity levels
Measure financial impact of defects (repair cost)
Analyze monthly defect trends
Evaluate inspection methods
Provide data-driven recommendations for quality improvement

# 📂 Dataset Source
Source: Kaggle (Public Dataset)
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle and is used for academic and portfolio purposes only.

# 📂 Dataset
Year: 2024
Metrics: Defect Type, Severity, Repair Cost, Month, Inspection Method

# 📈 Key Insights
Minor issues occur frequently, indicating process-level mistakes
Surface defects dominate, suggesting finishing/handling problems
Structural defects are most severe and costly → priority for root-cause analysis
Defects show a downward trend from January to June (quality improvement)
Manual and visual inspections detect more defects; automation needs enhancement

# 💡 Business Impact
Cost Reduction: Focus on structural defects first
Quality Improvement: Identifies process weaknesses
Operational Efficiency: Supports defect prevention strategies
Data-Driven Decisions: Enables management to act on insights

# 🛠 Tools Used
Tableau (Dashboard & Visualization)
Excel / CSV (Data Source)
PowerPoint (Project Presentation)

# Conclusion:
This Tableau dashboard provides actionable insights into manufacturing defects using 2024 data. It highlights high-impact defect types, compares inspection methods, and visualizes trends that support strategic quality improvements and cost reduction decisions. By presenting defects, severity, repair costs, and monthly variations clearly, the dashboard enables stakeholders to prioritize issues and enhance manufacturing performance.
